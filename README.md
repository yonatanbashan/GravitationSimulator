# GravitationSimulator
Simulates planet gravitation with graphics and user interface

Usage:
* Move to mass selector on the top-left corner to choose the planet mass
* Drag the mouse on the canvas (the black background) to give speed and direction to the new planet
* The longer the line is, the bigger the initial speed is
* Check "apply walls" to lock the planets inside a box-like room and see what happens!
